# US_Bike_share_data_analysis
This Python script mainly deals with the analysis and import of US bike share data and answer interesting questions about it
by computing descriptive statistics. 
We explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. 
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike
from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. 
Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock
or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems 
are used.
This Python script will use data provided by "Motivate", a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, 
to uncover bike share usage patterns, and then will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and
Washington, DC.
